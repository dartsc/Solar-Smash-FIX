I'd like to appreciate SirRalph14ubg on github for making this, I fixed this wanting to do the same thing. I couldnt help but notice how many games he has tried to copy off of but many of them do not work. I definitely learned alot during this.
I went thru many failures. If it wasnt for him, this project could've taken way longer then it already has. Thank you sirRalph.


Please go to his github and star some of his projects it would really make me happy: https://github.com/SirRalph14ubg
