I'd like to appreciate SirRalph14ubg on github for making this, I fixed this wanting to do the same thing. I couldnt help but notice how many games he has tried to copy off of but many of them do not work. I definitely learned alot during this.
I went thru many failures. If it wasnt for him, this project could've taken way longer then it already has. Thank you sirRalph.
